  title: "How To Do Simple Statistics"
---

One thing I could never really figure out until I was midway through my PhD was how to properly do statistics on my data. Here I am sharing some tips that I found useful to follow. Disclaimer: this workflow by any means is not extensive, I wrote it for myself, to gather the knowledge I already felt I have. This is meant to help undergraduate level bioscience students to wrangle different tests and statistics. If you have good suggestions on what to add to this page, please [contact me](mailto:<singh.marija@gmail.com>).
  
# What are you counting?  
  
<img src="files/fly.png" align="left"> What data is your dependent variable? Categorical (Nominal vs Ordinal?) or Numerical (Discrete vs Continuous)?   
<img src="files/fly.png" align="left"> Let us choose numerical. It can be a continuous (ratio) data, such age, height, weight, where you can have parts of a whole, such as 0.5 cm. Or it can be a discrete count, such as a number of somatic cells in a stem cell niche, or a number of students attending professor's yearly seminar. You can't possibly have 1/2 of a student.  
<img src="files/fly.png" align="left"> Let us choose discrete data, such as number of cells. What is your distribution? If your sample size is large enough (n $\gt$ 30), you can [assume normal distribution](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/normality-test-in-r#case-of-large-sample-sizes). If not, plot your data on a QQplot and see if it is bell-shaped.  
<img src="files/fly.png" align="left"> You might want to throw in a normality test such as Shapiro-Wilk’s test. Important!: Shapiro-Wilk’s test **assumes distribution is normal** for p $\gt$ 0.05. Meaning, if you get a p $\leqslant$ 0.05, your data is **not distributed normally**.
