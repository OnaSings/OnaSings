# I am Ona

Welcome to my personal website!  
Here you can learn about my background, research, and interests in biochemistry, molecular medicine, fruit fly genetics, and data science.

## About Me

I am a biochemist and data scientist from Lithuania.  
I completed my PhD in Molecular Medicine at the Hannover Biomedical Research School (Germany), with research experience at MDI Biological Laboratory (USA).  
My work focused on phase separation and membrane-less organelles, using fruit flies as a model system.

Currently, I am expanding my skills in Data Science & AI at Turing College.

Fun fact: I can find a four leaf clover 🍀 in any (medium small sized) meadow.
